This program is used to practice reading in a foreign language.
It takes a text file as input (in this example, it reads a book written in English) and splits it into individual paragraphs. 
It also takes a 'bookmark' file which contains the index of the last paragraph the user read. It has the functionality to translate the English paragraphs into another language (in this example, Russian) and display them side-by-side. 
Each sentence is highlighted in the text so that the user can read one sentence in English and the corresponding one in the other language. 
When the user has finished reading the paragraph, hitting enter saves the bookmark and moves to the next paragraph.
